# Projectile Simulator considering Spin and Drag

Projectile trajectories can be approximated by assuming projectiles move in a vaccum but especially when considering larger projectiles or trajectories it becomes important to consider two other dominant factors in projectile motion: Spin (the Magnus Effect) and Drag

This simulator uses a naive Eulers Method approach to solving the differential equations. An upcoming version of the simulator will use the Runge-Katta Method for a higher accuracy across larger time periods.
